                </h5>
                <p>        We had a inter School debate on Environment Pollution! As these days the Environment Pollution is getting on its peak! and afterwords our school figured that to stop the Environment Pollution we shold: 
         Using public transports.
Turn off the lights when not in use.
         <br>
Recycle and Reuse.
         <br>
No to plastic bags.
         <br>
Reduction of forest fires and smoking. 
         <br>
Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner. 
         <br>
Use filters for chimneys
         <br>. 
Avoid usage of crackers.
         <br>
         And so much more!
         <br>
         And from Doing this our school even recived a trophy for " the savers of  our Earth"</p>

                </h5>
                <p> We won second price in inter school Science Project competition! it was difficult but we still won second place! Our science project was "Crystal Growing " here is what we did: <br>
                    
                There are many different techniques for having fun with crystals. One of the most colorful methods involves dropping metal salts like calcium chloride, lead nitrate or copper sulfate into a solution of sodium silicate, but you will need to borrow those from the school's chemistry lab.If you would rather use off-the shelf materials for your crystal growing experiments, you can create a warm saturated solution with a crystal solute like salt, sugar, alum or aniline. Dip a bit of string into it and wait for it to cool off. The particles in the solution will aggregate around the surface of the string and create tiny seed crystals.After a few days you will have some gorgeous crystal formations
